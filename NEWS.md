# Changes in v0.9.0
- Since v0.9.0, the core functionality of FlightSims.jl has been detached as [FSimBase.jl](https://github.com/JinraeKim/FSimBase.jl), which also works alone!
- Since v0.9.0, the plotting tools for predefined environments has been detached as [FSimPlots.jl](https://github.com/JinraeKim/FSimPlots.jl).
- Some sub-directories, e.g., `src/algorithms`, `src/utils/approximators` have been deprecated. They will be detached as new packages if necessary.
